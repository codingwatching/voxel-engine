# bugs
- fix sculpting subtex overlapping issue near borders

# features
- exporting to .vox
- gl error checking

# not important features
- add a cool shader crosshair (like color, size and transparency)

# ideas
- i could make this engine into a voxel sculpting tool
- i could make a simple game with it
