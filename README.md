## Information about the project:
This is a voxel engine. You can use it to make voxel art, or you can just play around with it. In 3D computer graphics, a voxel represents a value on a regular grid in three-dimensional space. As with pixels in a 2D. So basically a voxel is a 3D pixel.

I made this project with no experience of how graphics API's worked, i had to learn everything from scratch and i learned a ton along the way. The project is made with C# and OpenGL.
