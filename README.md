<img width="512" alt="OJYno4" src="https://github.com/sjoerdev/voxel-engine/assets/59654421/bfb4d15b-2daa-4ade-b79d-b77b257b951d">

## Information:
This is a voxel engine. In 3D computer graphics, a voxel represents a value on a regular grid in three-dimensional space. Most game engines use polygons to render 3d worlds, which is why this engine is so unique. This engine is made entirely using the OpenGL graphics API and the C# programming language.

## Features:
- ray tracing
- voxel data serialization
- real time voxel editing (sculpting)
- support for a whide range of gpu's

## System Requirements:
- an OpenGL 3.3 capable graphics card
- a .NET runtime compatible operating system
